# python-api-challenge
Module 6 Challenge
## Overview
Using Weather API and Geoapify to see the weather conditions in a generated city list. Finding correlation between its weather conditions and latitude.
WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb are both code that gives a clear view of what we did to find the weather conditions and then the processing of that data to answer our questions.
In the output_data folder, you will find figures of scatter plots of Latitude vs. Temperature, Wind Speed, Cloudiness, and Humidity.
## Comments
I forgot to edit the gitignore file and pushed my api_keys into the main branch the first time. I then used "git filter-repo --path ..." to remove and erase my api_keys from github. Then I edited gitignore and pushed again.
